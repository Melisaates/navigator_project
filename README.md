Flutter Navigator Example

This is a simple Flutter project to demonstrate how to use the Navigator to navigate between different screens or pages in a Flutter app.
Project Structure

The project structure is straightforward:

    main.dart: The entry point of the Flutter app. It defines the main application widget.
    home_screen.dart: The home screen widget. This is the initial screen of the app.
    second_screen.dart: The second screen widget. This is the screen we navigate to from the home screen.

How It Works

This example demonstrates a basic Flutter app with two screens: the home screen and the second screen. Here's how the navigation works:

    The app starts at the HomeScreen, which is set as the home screen.

    On the HomeScreen, you will see a button labeled "Navigate to Second Screen."

    When you tap this button, it triggers the onPressed event, and the Navigator is used to push the SecondScreen onto the screen stack.

    Now, you are on the SecondScreen. You can go back to the HomeScreen by pressing the "Back" button in the app bar. The Navigator handles the stack navigation for you.

Prerequisites

Make sure you have Flutter and Dart installed on your system. You can follow the official Flutter installation guide: Flutter Installation.
Getting Started

To run this example, follow these steps:

    Clone this project to your local machine:

bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/flutter-navigator-example.git

    Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd flutter-navigator-example

    Run the project using Flutter:

bash

flutter run

    The app should start, and you will see the home screen. You can then navigate to the second screen and back.

Explore the Code

Take a look at the code in the main.dart, home_screen.dart, and second_screen.dart files to understand how navigation between screens is implemented using Flutter's Navigator.
